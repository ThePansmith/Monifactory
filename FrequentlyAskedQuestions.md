## Tech Support

**Q. The server says I don't have the right version of a mod, but I do! ([example pictured here](https://imgur.com/GL1GdwW))**

Odds are your config doesn't match the ones on the server. If the server is running on hardmode, make sure that you've updated your client too

**Q. My GregTech textures are all messed up!**

GregTech uses dynamically generated textures, reloading your resource packs may break this. Restarting the game should fix it
