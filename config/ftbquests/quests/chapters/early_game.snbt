				"With tier three circuits in hand, it's time to make a &3Distillation Tower&r, which is the gatekeeper for more advanced plastics like &6Epoxy&r and doing petrochemistry."
				""
				"The Distillation Tower is a highly flexible multiblock structure, able to be anywhere from &62 blocks high to up to 13 high&r (12 fluid outputs). The way that it works is that each level of the tower after the first will output an additional fluid from the recipe. &cAny output fluids in excess of available buses are voided&r. "
				""
				"What you need the Distillation Tower for initially is to break down &9Oil&r and &9Fermented Biomass&r into useful resources.&9 Oil&r distillation, with its four outputs, will require a &efive-block-high Distillation Tower&r (the quest materials are for such a tower; if you want to build it bigger, you will need &ean additional 7 casings and 1 fluid output per floor&r)."
				""
				"Any recipe with more than four output fluids (like &9Fermented Biomass&r) will need a larger tower. Make sure to increase the height of your tower to accommodate all of the outputs you want to keep. Also check the voltage requirements of the recipes, as many Distillation Tower recipes need higher voltages than MV. &eYou can swap out your Energy Input for a higher tier one when that time comes&r. Also, any recipe that has an item output will need an &6Output Bus&r, anywhere on the bottom layer."
				""
				"The tower we'll be building at first is 3x3x5 (LxWxH), with a hollow center. The &6Fluid Input Hatch&r &2can go anywhere on the bottom layer.&r. The &6controller&r goes in the middle of an outer edge of the bottom layer. The &6Energy Input Hatch&r can go wherever you can fit it on the bottom layer. The rest of the 3x3 must be filled with &6Clean Stainless Steel Casings&r.&2 You also need a Maintenance Hatch, which can go anywhere on the structure.&r Each level above that is a ring of 7 Clean Stainless Steel Casings, one &6Fluid Output&r and nothing in the center, except for the topmost layer which needs an eighth casing to fill in the center, capping off the top. "
				""
				"For distilling fluids which only have one useful output, like &9Biomass&r, it is recommended to use single-block Distilleries, due to their energy efficiency and generally lower costs."

				""
				"Oil is the starting point, and can be found in several variants which you can pump from finite natural wells on the Overworld, as well as coming renewably from &6Oilsands Ore&r and &6Soul Sand&r, and directly in liquid form from a &3Fluid Rig&r."
				""
				"&2The Fluid Rig can also harvest Raw Oil, Heavy Oil and Light Oil depending on your fluid vein. Raw Oil is similar to Oil, giving the same ratios when distilled but needing double the fluid. Heavy Oil and Light Oil give different ratios when distilled.&r "

				"These will all need to be hydrodesulfurized using &9Hydrogen&r in a &3Chemical Reactor&r or &2Oil Cracking Unit&r, which produces the non-Sulfuric versions."
