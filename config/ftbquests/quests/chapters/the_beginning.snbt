With &6Fluid Regulators&r, similar behavior is possible with fluids using a &aFluid Filter&r. For &6Conveyors&r and &6Pumps&r, it simply limits what that cover will move."

When placed inside a &6Robot Arm&r in &eKeep Exact&r or &eSupply Exact&r mode&r, the item count in a filter can be incremented by &eRight Clicking&r and decremented by &eLeft Clicking&r.
