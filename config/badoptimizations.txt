# Whether we should cancel updating the lightmap if not needed.
enable_lightmap_caching: true
# How much the in-game time must change in ticks (1/20th of a second)
# for the lightmap to immediately update.

# to block lighting, but better performance.
# Values below 2 will disable hte optimization.
