## Introduction ##

First off, thank you for your interest in contributing to this project! It's
people like you who are helping to make this project even better than it's ever
been before!

These guidelines exist to ensure all developers and contributors are on the same

project. Please read, understand, and do your best to follow them when
contributing.

## What Contributions Are We Seeking? ##

We are currently looking for the following kinds of contributions:

* Bug fixes
* Documentation improvements
* Small quality of life improvements
* Spelling/grammar fixes

Specifically, we are not looking for:

* Major changes/features
* Adding/removing core mods to/from the pack

## Getting Started ##

To begin making contributions to this project, you will likely want to create
your own fork of this repository. This can be done via the GitHub web UI. Please
see [this GitHub help article](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo)
for more information.

Once you have forked the repository you may make the changes you want, either in
the web UI or by cloning the repository locally.

After you have made your changes, please create a pull request. Once again, see
[this GitHub help article](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) for
more details.

### Things to Watch Out For ###

One notable thing to watch out for when modifying this mod pack is that we have
multiple difficulty "modes". These modes are located in the `config-overrides`
folder. Some files are copied into these folders and are used to replace files
located in the `config` folder when the `pack-mode-switcher.{sh,bat}` script is
run.

By default this mod pack is set to "normal" difficulty. Please double check that
any files you are working on are do not also exist inside the `config-overrides`
folder. If they do you will need to copy your changes over into them and adjust
them as appropriate for the difficulty setting that folder represents.
