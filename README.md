## Hard/Expert Mode
Is Monifactory not Greggy enough for you? Or do you simply want a challenge? Try Hard Mode (or even Expert Mode, if you're not faint of heart!)

Highlights include:

- Forced Peaceful Mode
- The Steam Age
- No Hostile Neural Networks for easy infinite resources
- Monicoins can't be spent
- Harder processing lines for Platinum and Naquadah
- More focus on GregTech Power Generation

Expert Mode is a modifier for Hard Mode, and takes things a step further by:

- Disabling RF -> EU conversion, making GT power generation required
- LaserIO is disabled
- GT5u-style machine explosions
- Various other nerfs
