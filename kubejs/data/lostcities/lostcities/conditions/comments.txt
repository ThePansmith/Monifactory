JSON does not allow for comments, so here's an explanation of how the loot system in the Lost Cities works.
See KubeJS/data/monifactory/loot_tables/chests/comments.txt for more information.

When the Lost Cities are generated, the mod selects a loot table to apply to each chest.
This file defines which loot table it applies, depending on:
- The structure the chest is in (inpart)
- The floor of the building the chest is on (range)
- Weighted random chance (factor)

In this case, we define a few custom loot tables that Lost Cities uses for these chests.
Note that "range", the floors each loot table applies to, is zero-indexed.
- cellar (applies to underground floors of buildings)
- ground_level (applies to the first through fifth floors of buildings)
- upper_floors (applies to the sixth floors and above)
- rail_dungeon (applies to "rail dungeons", which I have not personally encountered)
