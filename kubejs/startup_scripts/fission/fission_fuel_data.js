 * TODO: Determine how to integrate Americium (and optionally, Cm & Nq+ & Nq*) into fuel selection.
 * Neither isotope of Americium worth considering (241 and 243) are fissile.
 * They both require multiple neutron captures as fertile fuel,
 * which results in a net-negative neutron economy.
 *
 * Perhaps Americium could act as a more viable 'fertile' fuel for Naquadah isotopes,
 * which are presumably highly radioactive?
 * Otherwise, they would be interesting to have as breeder blanket targets for Curium.
