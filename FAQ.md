**Q. Can I add 'X' mod to Monifactory?**

By default, Monifactory only supports the mods included with it, and has optional compat for ComputerCraft, Create, and Tempad.

Note that support may not be provided for bugs related to mods not shipped with the pack

**Q. Will Monifactory be ported to 'X' Minecraft version?**

**Q. I've found a bug, where do I report it?**

### Tech Support

**Q. The server says I don't have the right version of a mod, but I do! ([example pictured here](https://imgur.com/GL1GdwW))**

Odds are your config doesn't match the ones on the server. If the server is running on Hard Mode, make sure that you've updated your client too

**Q. My GregTech textures are all messed up!**

GregTech uses dynamically generated textures, reloading your resource packs may break this. Restart your game to fix it

**Q. My game is crashing on MacOS!**

Remove Spark and ensure you are using an ARM64 version of Java 17 or higher

**Q. Making a superflat world crashes my game!**

This is a known issue with Lost Cities, disable the mod if you want to generate a superflat world

**Q. My UI elements are overlapping!**

Switch to a lower GUI scale or tweak EMI's UI configs to your liking. Alternatively, disable EMI temporarily using Ctrl + O

**Q. I lowered the rarity of Lost Cities, but I still spawn in one!**

Lost Cities is configured to always spawn the player in a city. Disable the mod entirely if you don't want them

**Q. My EnderIO filters aren't working!**

EnderIO 1.20 is not in a great state and not supported by the devs, don't expect a lot things to work. Try to use alternatives such as GregTech pipes or LaserIO (Energy conduits should work fine though)

**Q. My EnderIO conduits aren't extracting!**

Conduits are set by default to extract on high redstone input; click the redstone torch and switch to always on, low redstone, or whatever option you wish to use

**Q. Why is my UI so dark?**

DarkModeEverywhere is enabled by default, and makes your UI darker (duh). You can switch colors using the button in the bottom left of your inventory screen, or on the main menu

**Q. My issue isn't listed above!**

Report it to the [issue tracker](https://github.com/ThePansmith/Monifactory/issues), or get help on the [Discord](https://discord.gg/N8b2JEfAqb)
