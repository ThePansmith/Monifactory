# Frequently Asked Questions

## General

### About Monifactory

**Q. How "finished" is Monifactory?**

The main path of progression is fully playable - multiple groups have obtained the Creative Chest in Normal Mode.

**Q. Where can I download Monifactory?**

Stable releases of Monifactory can be downloaded from CurseForge using any launcher of your choice (PrismLauncher, CurseForge, etc.)
Bleeding edge builds can be found [here](https://github.com/ThePansmith/Monifactory/releases).

**Q. What's the difference between Monifactory and Nomifactory CEu?**

A comprehensive list of changes can be found [here](CHANGELOG.md).

**Q. Can my PC run Monifactory?**

Monifactory should run on any computer with a CPU newer than 2019. Allocating 6GB RAM or higher is recommended<br>.
``NOTE: If your computer has 8GB RAM or less, assume that Monifactory will not run on it.``

**Q. Can I play Monifactory on Peaceful mode?**

Yes! Peaceful mode is the intended playstyle for Monifactory. Playing with mobs and hunger do not have any additional benefits in Moni, and all mob drops are attainable early through other methods.

**Q. Can I port my Nomifactory world to Monifactory?**

Technically? Yes. In a practical sense? No. Loading the 1.12 world in 1.20.1 Monifactory *does* load vanilla Minecraft items and blocks and some GT ores properly, but it voids every other modded item or block - you will essentially be sent back to the stone age.

**Q. Will Monifactory be ported to 'X' Minecraft version?**

Monifactory will not be backported to any versions before 1.20.1. Porting the pack to a future version of Minecraft may or may not happen, but **do not ask or pester the devs**.

**Q. Is Create in the modpack?**

No, Create is not in Monifactory by default.

**Q. Are Lithium and Sodium in the modpack?**

No, but we have their respective port and fork, Radium and Embeddium.

**Q. Does the modpack come with shaders?**

Not by default. Oculus is included to load your shaders of choice, however.

**Q. Can you create or add 'X' mod to Monifactory?**

Create a feature request on the GitHub.

**Q. Can I add 'X' mod to my instance of Monifactory?**

By default, Monifactory only supports the mods included with it, and has *optional compat* for various mods, such as Create. Any other mods added may break progression and/or deviate from the intended experience. Note that support will not be provided for bugs related to mods not shipped with the pack.

## How Do I...?

**Q. How do I play Monifactory Hard Mode/Expert Mode?**

[Instructions can be found here](https://github.com/ThePansmith/Monifactory?tab=readme-ov-file#hardexpert-mode-installation)

**Q. How do I update the modpack?**
*Make a backup first.*
Your launcher's built-in update function should work most of the time.

If it doesn't:
1. Download an entirely new copy of Monifactory
2. Copy the following folders from your old instance of Monifactory to the new instance:
    `backups`
    `journeymap`
    `saves`
    `schematics` (if you have any)
    `shaderpacks` (if you have any)
    `emi.json`
    `options.txt`
    `pack-mode-switcher` (If your modpack was not in Normal Mode)
3. Adjust the pack mode of the new instance, if needed (Instructions above)

**Q. How do I add optional compat mods?**

[Instructions can be found here](https://github.com/ThePansmith/Monifactory?tab=readme-ov-file#Addon-Mods-AKA-Optional-Compats)

**Q. How do I setup a dedicated multiplayer server?**

## Tech Support

### Gameplay

**Q. Where should I build my base?**

This is your decision to make - You don't ask others to decide what you should eat for lunch!
If you want a comparison of the available dimensions:
- Overworld: Pretty landscapes & easy access to resources, but some find the terrain difficult to build around.
- Void Dimension: Always day, but featureless and nothing to build off of. Good for potato computers.
- Luna, Mars, Mercury, or Venus: Mostly featureless, flat terrain. You need Oxygen and a spacesuit to breathe.
- Planetary Orbit dimensions: Similar to the Void Dimension, but you need Oxygen and a spacesuit to breathe.
- Lost Cities Dimension: Cities cover most terrain, and are damaged. No Ores.
- Nether/End: Rich in resources, but potentially hazardous. Same generation as in Vanilla but with GregTech ores.
- AE2 Spatial Storage: 128x128 size limit. Can be combined & traversed in creative ways.

**Q. I can't light my Nether portal?!?**

In Monifactory, both the Nether and End portals are disabled.
TelePastries' cakes are used to move between dimensions instead.

**Q. My EnderIO conduits aren't extracting!**

Conduits are set by default to extract on high redstone input; click the redstone torch and switch to always on, low redstone, or whatever option you wish to use

**Q. My Cleanroom isn't forming!**

The entire top layer except the controller, edges & corners needs to be made of Cleanroom Filter Casings. The multi also needs an energy hatch and a maintenance hatch.

**Q. My Rocket isn't forming!**

Refer to the [GCYR Wiki](https://github.com/Argent-Matter/gcyr/wiki) for questions relating to space and rocketry.

**Q. Why is my UI so dark?**

DarkModeEverywhere is enabled by default, and makes your UI darker (duh). You can switch colors using the button in the bottom left of your inventory screen, or on the main menu

**Q. My dynamo isn't outputting energy?**

Thermal Expansion Dynamos will only output energy while producing it.

### Servers

**Q. How do I update Monifactory on my server?**

In your server directory delete config-overrides, config, defaultconfig, kubejs, and mods. Then from the new Monifactory server zip copy over those same directories to replace the ones you removed. Enjoy!

<!--- Essential PSA, I've commented this out for now. Feel free to edit/uncomment 

**Q. Does Monifactory support Essential world hosting?**

Essential is not officially supported, and various unsupported bugs and crashes may arise from hosting using it. Support will not be provided for these -->

### Other Issues

**Q. Where do I report an issue?**

Check the [Known Issues document](KNOWN-ISSUES.md) first. If it's not there, report it to the [issue tracker](https://github.com/ThePansmith/Monifactory/issues), or get help on the [Discord](https://discord.gg/N8b2JEfAqb) in the #moni-support channel
