# Monifactory Changelog (WIP)
(Coming from Nomifactory CEu)

Like this list, some features here are WIP.


# Post-Tank Overhaul
* The entirety of post-tank has been remade from the ground up, featuring new mechanics, tiers, etc.
* 2 New Microminers
* 3 New Circuit Tiers
    * Matter, Dimensional, Monic
* 5 New Post-Tank Multiblocks
    * Omnic Forge, for late-game material processing
    * Dimensional Superassembler, a parallelizable assembly line
    * Loot Superfabricator, made to meet the speeds of the Simulation Supercomputer
    * Hyperbolic Microverse Projector, a parallelizable projector, able to perform all microverse missions, as well as a couple of its own.
    * Helical Fusion Reactor, (Hard mode/Expert mode only!) for speedy late-game fusion recipes
    * Subatomic Digital Assembler, see below 
* The Creative Tank Replicator has been reworked into the Subatomic Digital Assembler, allowing it to construct other items
    * Creative Tank can now replicate both creative quantum tanks and creative fluid ME cells
    * Creative Storage can replicate quantum tanks, chests, and Soph Storage Max Upgrades
    * Creative Computation Data can replicate creative computation providers and creative data access hatches.
    * Creative Energy can replicate GregTech energy emitter, EnderIO creative energy, and AE2 Creative Energy Cell
    * Some interesting things can happen if you try to replicate the unreplicatable...
* The Nomifactory "a billion patterns for random bullshit" post-tank experience is no more
* New processing chains
* New SMD tier : Complex SMDs
* New 13x13 Extended Crafting table tier, used for the new microminers


# Early-game Changes
* Steel changes (Normal mode only)
    * Primitive Blast Furnace has been removed.
    * Steel can be made from both Iron and Wrought Iron in a Crafting Table or an Alloy Smelter.
    * Wrought iron has a decreased recipe time in the Alloy Smelter - using the wrought iron recipe in a Steam Foundry allows for subsecond steel. 
* New Multiblocks to aid in progression
    * The Steam Foundry allows for quickly alloying resources in the earlygame
    * The Steam Separator removes the early-game gallium ore processing woes (and getting more stuff for free is just cool)
    * The Greenhouse allows you to easily grow large amounts of crops and trees
* ULV Covers has been ported, and can be bought with Monicoins
* The Thermal phytogenic insolator has been reworked to be an earlygame way to easily passive wood and sticky resin for cheap
* Kanthal, Silicon no longer require cooling, chemical bath or otherwise
* Angel Ring is available earlier


# Mid-game Changes
* The Multismelter now also works as a parallelizable alloy smelter (new to GregTech CEu Modern)
* New microminer missions
* 4 new GCyM-style multiblocks for your parallelization needs
* Infinite ME water and cobblestone cells


# Late-game Changes 
* Refer to Draconic Removal Section below for more info regarding sculk changes.
* RTM Alloy Coils added, replacing Tungstensteel
* New Multiblocks
    * XLCR, a parallelizable Large Chemical Reactor that can be powered with lasers
    * Quintessence Infuser, a parallelizable Soul Binder unlocked in ZPM


# Storage Upgrades
* Sophisticated Storage/Backpacks
    * Custom progression
    * Steel barrels have 3x the storage space of a regular barrel without upgrades 
* Storage Drawers replaced with Functional Storage
    * Drawers can pull, push, store fluids, and void with proper upgrades
    * Drawers connect to the Drawer Controller wirelessly with a Linking Tool
    * Framing Templates
* AE2 changes
    * Built in AE2 Fluid Crafting, and other modern changes.
    * ExtendedAE
    * ME Requester, gated to LuV
    * Extended Crafting autocrafting tables received a massive speed buff
    * AE2 now uses AE2 Silicon rather than GregTech Silicon, meaning you can get into AE2 faster
    * Modern AE2 Additions brings pattern P2P to modern versions and another cool features.
    * MEGA Cells
    * Multi P2P, which can have multiple inputs and multiple outputs


# Deeper Mob Learning
* DML replaced with HNN, new textures on some items
* The pristine chance constantly improves with each operation, instead of increasing after the model's tier increases (new to HNN)
* Warden Data Model, etc (see below)


# Draconic Removal
* **Draconic Evolution** has been removed, with the Fusion mechanic replaced with a new mechanic involving sculk-based energy cores.
    * Deep Dark Data, Lair of the Warden, Warden Data Model replace Draconic equivalents
    * Cryolobus replaces Draconium, and Cryococcus replaces Awakened Draconium
    * Sculk-themed equivalents for previously draconic-themed items and machines
    * Craft energy-dense Sculk Cores into multiple tiers of Energy Cores
    * Energy cores can release their stored energy in the Discharger (new multiblock) to craft items
* **Avaritia** is gone
    * Possibly the only expert pack without Avaritia or DE? (even TJ has DE)
* **Actually Additions** and **Extra Utilities 2** have been replaced with Gregified alternatives


# Mods created for the pack
* **Extended Crafting: Expanded** adds a new tier of extended crafting table and makes the autocrafting tables faster
* **Functional GregTech Drawers** adds rubber and treated wood drawers to Functional Storage 
    * **Functional Thermal Drawers** does the same for Thermal rubberwood
* **GregTech Steam Additions** adds two multiblocks to the Steam Age: the Steam Foundry and Steam Seperator
* **ULV Covers Modern**, adds ULV covers (duh) 
* **Classic Steam Dynamo**, porting the 1.12 Steam Dynamo to Modern
* **Framing Templates** adds replicable Framing Template items that can be used to decorate frameable drawers from Functional Storage


# Worldgen Overhaul

    * Cities are larger, but rarer
    * Guaranteed spawn in or near a Lost City.
    * Cities have lighting, no explosion damage, and every chest now has loot
* William Wythers' Overhauled Overworld changes the terrain generation in the Overworld
* Veins' ore density has been sharply increased to help get you into making machines even quicker
