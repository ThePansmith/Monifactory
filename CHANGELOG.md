# Early-game Changes
* Steel changes (Normal mode only)
    * Primitive Blast Furnace has been removed.
    * Steel can be made from both Iron and Wrought Iron in a Crafting Table or an Alloy Smelter.
    * Wrought iron has a decreased recipe time in the Alloy Smelter - using the wrought iron recipe in a Steam Foundry allows for subsecond steel. 
* New Multiblocks to aid in progression
    * The Steam Foundry allows for quickly alloying resources in the earlygame
    * The Steam Separator removes the early-game gallium ore processing woes (and getting more stuff for free is just cool)
    * The Greenhouse allows you to easily grow large amounts of crops and trees
* ULV Covers has been ported, and can be bought with Monicoins
* The Thermal phytogenic insolator has been reworked to be an earlygame way to easily passive wood and sticky resin for cheap
* Kanthal, Silicon no longer require cooling, chemical bath or otherwise
* Angel Ring is available earlier


# Mid-game Changes
* The Multismelter now also works as a parallelizable alloy smelter (new to GregTech CEu Modern)
* Microminer Rework
* 4 new GCyM-style multiblocks for your parallelization needs
* Infinite ME water and cobblestone cells
* Space travel is now handled by Ad Astra

# Microminer Overhaul
* Microminers have been reworked to be worth automating for resources
* Microminers themselves now return from missions, with the bulk of the cost now coming from easier to automate secondary resources 
    * Microminer mission outputs have been adjusted to account for this, resulting in a massive net buff for missions
* Added various new missions
* Added a Tier 2.5 Microminer for earlygame mob drop gathering in Hardmode


# Late-game Changes 
* Refer to Draconic Removal Section below for more info regarding sculk changes.
* RTM Alloy Coils added, replacing Tungstensteel
* New Multiblocks
    * Quintessence Infuser, a parallelizable Soul Binder unlocked in ZPM
    * Large Naquadah Reactor, a new method of power generation.


# Endgame Overhaul
* The entirety of post-tank has been remade from the ground up, featuring new mechanics, tiers, etc.
* Creative tank itself have been removed, with focus being returned to scaling up your existing factory instead of nullifying your entire factory.
* 2 New Microminers
* 3 New Circuit Tiers
    * Matter, Dimensional, Monic
* 6 New Post-Tank Multiblocks
    * Omnic Forge, for late-game material processing
    * Dimensional Superassembler, a parallelizable assembly line
    * Loot Superfabricator, made to meet the speeds of the Simulation Supercomputer
    * Hyperbolic Microverse Projector, a parallelizable projector, able to perform all microverse missions, as well as a couple of its own.
    * Helical Fusion Reactor, (Hard mode/Expert mode only!) for speedy late-game fusion recipes
    * Sculk Biocharger, capable of performing both Charging and Discharging (more on those below) recipes in parallel
    * Subatomic Digital Assembler, see below 
* The Creative Tank Replicator has been reworked into the Subatomic Digital Assembler, allowing it to construct other items
    * Creative Storage can replicate quantum tanks, chests, and Soph Storage Max Upgrades
    * Creative Computation Data can replicate creative computation providers and creative data access hatches.
    * Creative Energy can replicate GregTech energy emitter, EnderIO creative energy, and AE2 Creative Energy Cell
    * Some interesting things can happen if you try to replicate the unreplicatable...
* More interesting power generation with the Large Naquadah Reactor and Naquadah Refinery 
* New processing chains and materials 
* New SMD tier: Complex SMDs
* New 13x13 Extended Crafting table tier, used for the new microminers


# Storage Upgrades
* Sophisticated Storage/Backpacks
    * Custom progression
    * Steel barrels have 3x the storage space of a regular barrel without upgrades 
* Storage Drawers replaced with Functional Storage
    * Drawers can pull, push, store fluids, and void with proper upgrades
    * Drawers connect to the Drawer Controller wirelessly with a Linking Tool
    * Framing Templates
* AE2 changes
    * Built in AE2 Fluid Crafting, and other modern changes.
    * ExtendedAE
    * ME Requester, gated to ZPM
    * Extended Crafting autocrafting tables received a massive speed buff
    * AE2 now uses AE2 Silicon rather than GregTech Silicon, meaning you can get into AE2 faster
    * Modern AE2 Additions brings pattern P2P to modern versions and another cool features.
    * MEGA Cells
    * Multi P2P, which can have multiple inputs and multiple outputs
    * Assembler Matrix


# Laser Transportation 
* LaserIO-UEL now serves as the primary method of power transportation with new tiered energy overclockers, allowing LaserIO power transporation to be a option from the get-go
    * LaserIO's energy throughput is super easy to upgrade, as only extracting cards requires an overclocker, and is as simple as swapping the card out.
    * LaserIO's lasers are also colorable, able to go through blocks, and more!


# Deeper Mob Learning
* DML replaced with HNN, new textures on some items
* The pristine chance constantly improves with each operation, instead of increasing after the model's tier increases (new to HNN)
* Warden Data Model, etc (see below)


# Draconic Removal
* **Draconic Evolution** has been removed, with the Fusion mechanic replaced with a new mechanic involving sculk-based energy cores.
    * Deep Dark Data, Lair of the Warden, Warden Data Model replace Draconic equivalents
    * Cryolobus replaces Draconium, and Cryococcus replaces Awakened Draconium
    * Sculk-themed equivalents for previously draconic-themed items and machines
    * Craft energy-dense Sculk Cores into multiple tiers of Energy Cores
    * Energy cores can release their stored energy in the Discharger (new multiblock) to craft items
* **Avaritia** is gone
    * Possibly the only expert pack without Avaritia or DE? (even TJ has DE)
* **Actually Additions** and **Extra Utilities 2** have been replaced with Gregified alternatives


# Space Traveling
* Ad Astra is now used for space travel
  * Overall a more straightforward and stable mod compared to Advanced Rocketry 
* New veins, both ore and fluids are avaible on extraterrestrial planets to have exploring them more worth it
* Ad Astra decoration blocks are now crafted with Gregtech materials 


# Mods created for the pack
* **Extended Crafting: Expanded** adds a new tier of extended crafting table and makes the autocrafting tables faster
