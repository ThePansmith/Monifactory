    * Creative Tank can now replicate both creative quantum tanks and creative fluid ME cells
    * Creative Storage can replicate quantum tanks, chests, and Soph Storage Max Upgrades
    * Creative Computation Data can replicate creative computation providers and creative data access hatches.
    * Creative Energy can replicate GregTech energy emitter, EnderIO creative energy, and AE2 Creative Energy Cell
    * Some interesting things can happen if you try to replicate the unreplicatable...

# Early-game Changes
* Steel changes (Normal mode only)
    * Steel is now craftable as a dust, and can be smelted
    * Primitive Blast Furnace has been removed from progression 
    * Steel can be made from both iron and wrought iron in a alloy smelter, with wrought iron having a decreased recipe time.
      * Using the wrought iron recipe in a Steam Foundry allows for subsecond steel. 
* New Multiblocks to aid in progression
  * The Steam Foundry allows for quickly alloying resources in the earlygame
  * The Steam Separator removes the early-game gallium ore processing woes (and getting more stuff for free is just cool)
  * The Greenhouse allows you to easily grow large amounts of crops and trees
* ULV Covers has been ported, and are buyable with Monicoins
* The Thermal phytogenic insolator has been reworked to be an earlygame way to easily passive wood and sticky resin for cheap

* Angel Ring is available earlier 
* ME infinite water and cobblestone cells


# Mid-game Changes
* The Multismelter now also works as a parallelizable alloy smelter (new to GregTech modern)

    * Functional GregTech Drawers, Functional Thermal Drawers
    * Framing Templates
* AE2 changes
    * Built in AE2 Fluid Crafting, and other modern changes.
    * ExtendedAE
    * ME Requester
    * Extended Crafting autocrafting tables received a massive speed buff
    * AE2 now uses AE2 Silicon rather than GregTech Silicon, meaning you can get into AE2 faster
    * Modern AE2 Additions brings pattern P2P to modern versions and another cool features.
    * MEGA Cells
